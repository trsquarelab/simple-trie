Introduction
------------
This is an implementation of a generic prefix trie. The code is written in pure C++ template. The trie is very similar to STL associative container in its usage.

Currently following features are supported.

* Iterator support
* Addition of an element
* Removal of an element
* Retrieval of an element
* Checking the existence of an element
* Finding element with a given key
* Finding elements with common prefix 

See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie for more information about Trie.
